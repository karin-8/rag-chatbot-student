# RAG Chatbot - Starter

Local, offline RAG chatbot over a small set of fictional LumaBox support
policies - the same use case, models, and functions from your Week 5 Colab
activity (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for embeddings, `flan-t5-base` for generation),
rebuilt the way AI engineers run it for real: a persistent knowledge base, a
versioned prompt, an enforced policy, a golden dataset with a quality gate,
a CI/CD pipeline, and tracing for continuous monitoring.

Look for `TODO` comments (`git grep -n TODO`, or search in VS Code):
`I1-I4` in `src/ingest.py`, `R1-R6` in `src/rag.py`, `T1` in
`tests/test_retrieval.py`, and `T2` (rows for `tests/golden.json`) in
`tests/test_golden.py`. Everything else is already written.

## Before class

You need VS Code (with the Python extension), Python 3.11-3.13, and git.
Then, from this folder:

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
Mac/Linux:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup_check.py
```

`setup_check.py` downloads the two models (~1.1 GB, once) and confirms
everything loads. In class, `python setup_check.py --offline` proves nothing
needs downloading.

## Run (once the TODOs are filled in)

Always run from the project folder, as a module (`python -m ...`). VS Code's
Run button runs the file as a loose script and fails with
`No module named 'src'`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python -m src.ingest` | Build the knowledge base (re-run when documents change) |
| `python -m src.main` | Chat in the terminal; every turn is traced to `logs/` |
| `python -m src.scores` | Top retrieval similarity for some questions |
| `python -m src.policy_demo` | Compare answers with and without the policy |
| `pytest` | Unit and golden dataset tests (must all pass) |
| `python -m src.gate` | Quality gate: generated answers vs the baseline |
| `python -m src.review` | Review traces: flags, a random sample, sentiment |
| `streamlit run app.py` | The web front end the production container runs |
